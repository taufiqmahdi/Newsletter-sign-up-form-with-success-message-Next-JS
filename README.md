## Overview

  

### The challenge

  

Users should be able to:

  

- Add their email and submit the form

- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form

- See form validation messages if:

	- The field is left empty

	- The email address is not formatted correctly

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

  

### Built with

  

- Mobile-first workflow

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- TypeScript

  

  

### What I learned

  - Because NextJS can only receive params, this is how both Child and Parent declare props:

```js
///Child
interface Props {
	params: {
		email: string;
		onEmailChange: Dispatch<SetStateAction<string>>;
	}
}

export  default  function Page({params}: Props) {
	const {email, onEmailChange} = params;

	return (
		///JSX element here
	)
}

///Parent
export  default  function Page() {
	const [email, setEmail] = useState('')

	return (
		<>
			{email == '' ? (<Home  params={{onEmailChange: setEmail, email: email}}  />) : (<Confirmed  params={{onEmailChange: setEmail, email: email}}  />)}
		</>
	);
}
```

- Type on Form Event, Form Input, and such as:
```js
const submitForm = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
	e.preventDefault()
	
	onEmailChange((e.currentTarget.email as HTMLInputElement).value)
}
```


### Continued development

  - Using TypeScript for the next projects
  - Writing clean TypeScript code
  - Using TypeScript with React
